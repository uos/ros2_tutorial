## Information for Teachers

When the students reached certain points, I explained the theory and some practical things in more detail on the blackboard. This included, for example:

- Introductions
- Sensors
- Kalman-Filter (beginning with 1D example)
- SLAM pose graph incl. different uncertainties for linear and rotational motion
- MCL, kidnapped robot problem, multimodal distributions
- Nav2, layers, search algorithms, ...

Furthermore, I am aware of more nice ROS tools that help to finish things faster. However, I did not mention them because the students had to learn enough commands anyways.

These tutorials were tested by 12 undergraduate students of Osnabr√ºck Univertity. They were in their 3rd or 5th semester and did not have much experience with C++, nor with CMake, or Linux. It took them 6 days to finish with `ex04_navigation`. They then had to work on a project for about 1.5 weeks and give a 30-minute presentation including a demonstration at the end. The remaining days were spent on documentation. In total, it took 3 weeks full-time.
